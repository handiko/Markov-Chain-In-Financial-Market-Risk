# Other Examples: Markov Chain In Financial Market Risk
Other than the market directionality, like in the previous examples, in this article, I'd like to measure the market risk in terms of volatility using Markov chain analysis. Instead of an up or down day, we'll see a sequence of High or Low volatility days preceding a High or Low volatility day.

## Basic Understanding of Market Volatility
My definition of market volatility is as simple as: **"How large is the distance between the high of the day and the low of the day?"**. In other words, volatility is **the price range of the day**. (at least in my definition).
It could be measured in percent, pips, standard deviation, or any units that are suitable for each case.

My definition of today's volatility is **"the price distance between the high of the day and the low of the day, compared to the open price of the day, measured in percent"**.

$$
V = 100 \frac{{P_H - P_L}}{P_O}
$$
